Product merchandising
=====================

Drupal Commerce Core offers us powerful pricing options that store administrators can leverage to the extent of their store needs. Store admins can create very clever and complex pricing scenarios to entice customers and increase sales.

Promotions and coupons give us the ability to setup and configure pricing rules to meet the store's needs. It can be created quite easily and can be applied to an entire order total or per product.
