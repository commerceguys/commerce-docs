Adding a Coupon
===============

Let's now imagine that we're running a new email campaign that sends customers a coupon that they can use to get 15% off each order over $100. Setting up a coupon based promotion is almost exactly the same as what we did above.

We go through the same steps as creating a promotion, but with one exception. We now use the "Add New Coupon" button.
  - Enter a specific coupon code
  - Mark it as active
  - Set the number of times this coupon can be used

That's it. Now, "Save" the promotion. Let's test this out by adding a few products that amount to an order total of over $100. Notice that a discount is not automatically applied as we have added a coupon to the promotion. Instead, in the "Checkout" page, we see a 'Coupon code' textfield. Enter the coupon code in the promotion and hit "Apply coupon". You can now see that the 15% discount has been applied to the entire order.
