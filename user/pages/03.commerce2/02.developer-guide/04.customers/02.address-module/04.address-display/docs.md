This documentation page describes how you can customize how addresses are displayed.

### Options for displaying addresses
The Address module includes two formatters for displaying addresses: *Default* and *Plain*.
* The *Default* formatter uses a repository of address format data (provided by the Commerce Guys Addressing Library) to display an address. Google's [Address Data Service](https://chromium-i18n.appspot.com/ssl-address) is the data source for these address formats.
* The *Plain* formatter also relies on the addressing library data but only to get the subdivision code and name values, since the *Plain* formatter doesn't actually format the addresses; instead, the *Plain* formatter uses the `address-plain.html.twig` twig template for the actual address formatting.
* If you require customizations that are not possible with either of these formatters, you can create your own custom field formatter plugin.
