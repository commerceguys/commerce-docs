## Preparing the local environment

Start by setting up a web server, PHP and MySQL. We recommend [Drupal VM] for
advanced users, [Acquia Dev Desktop] for beginners.

You will also need [Git] and [Composer]. Note that Drupal VM comes with Composer included.

## Getting Commerce

The following command will download Drupal 8 + Commerce 2.x with all
dependencies to the `mystore` folder:

```bash
composer create-project drupalcommerce/project-base mystore --prefer-source --stability dev
```

The –prefer-source option tells Composer to use Git clone as the download method.

When prompted, answer **n** to:

```text
Do you want to remove the existing VCS (.git, .svn..) history? [Y,n]?
```

This will keep the downloaded git repositories inside their parent folders (such
as `web/modules/contrib/commerce`).

Tips:

-  The `bin` folder contains [Drupal Console] and [PHPUnit].
-  The `web` folder represents the document root.
-  Composer commands are always run from the site root (`mystore` in this case).
-  Downloading additional modules: `composer require "drupal/devel"`
-  Updating an existing module: `composer update drupal/address –with-dependencies`

See the [project-base README] for more details.

## Preparing your fork

**Note:** You will need a GitHub account for contributing.

Visit the Commerce [repository on GitHub] and click the **fork** button. That
will create a copy of the repository on your GitHub account.

Now go to the Commerce folder and add your fork:

```bash
cd /path/to/mystore
cd web/modules/contrib/commerce
git remote add fork git@github.com:YOUR_USER/commerce.git
```

Replace YOUR\_USER with your username (the full url is shown on your
fork’s GitHub page).

You will now be able to push new branches to your fork and create [pull requests]
against the main repository.

## Running tests

All of the Drupal Commerce tests are based on the PHPUnit framework. In
order to run the tests you will need to copy the `phpunit.xml.dist`
from the core directory and modify it for your environment. An in depth
article on getting ready to run the tests can be found here:
<https://drupalcommerce.org/blog/45322/commerce-2x-unit-kernel-and-functional-tests-oh-my>

```bash
cd /path/to/mystore/web
# Run PHPUnit tests
../bin/phpunit -c core/phpunit.xml modules/contrib/commerce
```

### Example **phpunit.xml** environment settings.

This `phpunit.xml` assumes you will be using SQLite (requires PHP SQLite extension) and
the Drupal site accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

```xml
<!-- Snippet of environment settings. -->
  <php>
    <!-- Set error reporting to E_ALL. -->
    <ini name="error_reporting" value="32767"/>
    <!-- Do not limit the amount of memory tests take to run. -->
    <ini name="memory_limit" value="-1"/>
    <!-- Example SIMPLETEST_BASE_URL value: http://localhost -->
    <env name="SIMPLETEST_BASE_URL" value="http://localhost:8080"/>
    <!-- Example SIMPLETEST_DB value: mysql://username:password@localhost/databasename#table_prefix -->
    <env name="SIMPLETEST_DB" value="sqlite://localhost/sites/default/files/.ht.sqlite"/>
    <!-- Example BROWSERTEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY value: /path/to/webroot/sites/simpletest/browser_output -->
    <!--<env name="BROWSERTEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" value="/path/to/drupal8/sites/simpletest/browser_output"/>-->
    <env name="BROWSERTEST_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" value="/path/to/drupal8/sites/simpletest/browser_output"/>
    <ini name="display_errors" value="On" />
    <ini name="display_startup_errors" value="On" />
  </php>
```

You can run `php -S localhost:8080` from within your Drupal site to allow the tests to run.
