Shipping methods are created by clicking the *Add shipping method* button on '/admin/commerce/shipping-methods' or by going straight to on '/admin/commerce/shipping-methods/add'.

On this page you assign the method to any of your stores and you can define the desired title, plugin, labels, description, amount, and conditions for your shipping method. 

The conditions allows you to create dedicated shipping methods for particular roles, countries, stores, products, order types, weight, and much more.
