There are various ways to display prices. Drupal Commerce provides several price field formatters and a Twig filter.

## Rendering prices in Twig.

There is the `commerce_price_format` Twig filter which renders a given Price value object based on its currency definition. Here is an example of using the Twig filter by utilizing the `inline_template` element type.

```
$element['price'] = [
  '#type' => 'inline_template',
  '#template' => '{{ price|commerce_price_format }}',
  '#context' => [
    'price' => new \Drupal\commerce_price\Price('10.25', 'USD'),
  ],
];
```

This would render as $10.25.

## Field formatters

### Plain

Prints the price using the `commerce_price_plain` theme hook. Resembles `10.25 USD`. Can be useful for exported data (CSV).

### Default

Uses the number formatter service to return marked up output. Same output as Twig filter.

### Calculated price

Returns price formatted for its currency, however it uses price resolving and can take into consideration other adjustments (promotions.)
