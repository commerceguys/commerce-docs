The Drupal Commerce Payment module provides a framework for implementing online payment gateways. Most of the code you will need to write is gateway specific. This documentation section includes examples for several types of payment gateways.

#### [Getting started](01.getting-started)
- Create a custom module, configuration schema, and a payment gateway plugin.
- Implement the configuration form for your custom payment gateway plugin.

#### [On-site payment gateways](02.on-site-gateways)
- Learn how to create payments and handle stored payment methods.
- Learn how to handle authorizations, voids, and refunds.

#### [Off-site payment gateways](03.off-site-gateways)
- Create the payment off-site form for either a Redirect or iFrame payment gateway
- Learn how to handle the return and/or asynchronous payment notifications (IPNs) from the payment provider.
- Make sure you understand security considerations that are particularly important for off-site payment gateways.

#### [Manual payment gateways](04.manual-gateways)
- TBD
