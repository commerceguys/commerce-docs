Introduction
------------

Drupal Commerce relies on the
[Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api) and
[Facets](https://www.drupal.org/project/facets) modules in order to create
catalog and product pages. The Search API module allows you to search the
Commerce products using a [server](https://www.drupal.org/node/1999262) that
satisfies your needs. A catalog and product page can then be created using the
[views module](https://www.drupal.org/project/views) for displaying search
results.Facets can then be created that will allow a site user to filter through
the products on the catalog and product pages. The following section provides a
detailed description of how to achieve this.
