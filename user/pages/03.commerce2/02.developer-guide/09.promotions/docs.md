The Drupal Commerce Promotion module provides Promotion and Coupon entities for creating and managing promotional campaigns on your shop. At the moment, these entity types does not provide any UI to manage fields. But you can use the `hook_entity_base_field_info` Drupal core hook to alter their fields according to your needs.
