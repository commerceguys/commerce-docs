Developer guide
===============

This section is for anyone implementing Drupal Commerce. It explains dependencies and how they are used and shows differents integration options.

The Developer guide is primarily for audiences who may have a WooCommerce background, for example. It is assumed for anyone who is using Drupal Commerce for the first time.

We will include an Adapting from 1.x section. This is a section that essentially highlights how developer implementations in 1.x would be done in 2.x
