## Create a product variation type

Following the example of having a t-shirt, the first step is to create a new product variation type for our t-shirt. Go to ``admin/commerce/config/product-variation-types``

![Configuration form](../../images/commerce-configuration-variation-types.png)

Click **Add product variation type**

![Click on Add product variation type](../../images/product-variation-1.png)

This will open a form.

![Fill product variation form](../../images/product-variation-2.png)

Now we will add image field to our product variation.

Click on **Manage fields** and then click on **Add field**

![Click Add field under Manage fields tab](../../images/product-variation-3.png)

Now select field type Image under *Reference*.

![Create an image field](../../images/product-variation-4.png)

Then click on **Save and continue**. Then save the settings for image field.

In these steps we added an image field to the variation. This allows us to upload a picture of the t-shirt based on its color. As the customer chooses a color to purchase, it will show that image.
