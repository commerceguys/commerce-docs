If you need customization for your product displays beyond what is possible using the administration UI, then you will probably need to create custom Twig templates as part of a custom theme. This is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this Drupal Commerce documentation guide. For an overview, please see the [Theming Drupal Guide] on Drupal.org.

Use twig.debug: true

### Default product template: commerce-product.html.twig

Start by copying this template from the Drupal Commerce product module's templates folder into your custom theme.
Use Manage display for your product type to make sure that all the fields you want displayed are enabled for the Default display mode.
If you want to be able to display variation fields, product variation field injection should be enabled. Also, make sure that all the variation fields you want displayed are enabled for the Default display mode for the variation type.

Variables available:
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the wrapper.
 * - product: The rendered product fields.
 *   Use 'product' to print them all, or print a subset such as
 *   'product.title'. Use the following code to exclude the
 *   printing of a given field:
 *   @code
 *   {{ product|without('title') }}
 *   @endcode
 * - product_entity: The product entity.
 * - product_url: The product URL.
