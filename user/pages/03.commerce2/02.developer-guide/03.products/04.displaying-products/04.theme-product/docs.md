If you need customization for your product displays beyond what is possible using the administration UI, then you will probably need to create custom Twig templates as part of a custom theme. This is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this Drupal Commerce documentation guide. For an overview, please see the [Theming Drupal Guide] on Drupal.org.

How to use twig to create a layout by hand.

Use twig.debug: true

### Default product template: commerce-product.html.twig

Start by copying this template from the Drupal Commerce product module's templates folder into your custom theme.
Use Manage display for your product type to make sure that all the fields you want displayed are enabled for the Default display mode.
If you want to be able to display variation fields, product variation field injection should be enabled. Also, make sure that all the variation fields you want displayed are enabled for the Default display mode for the variation type.

Variables available:
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the wrapper.
 * - product: The rendered product fields.
 *   Use 'product' to print them all, or print a subset such as
 *   'product.title'. Use the following code to exclude the
 *   printing of a given field:
 *   @code
 *   {{ product|without('title') }}
 *   @endcode
 * - product_entity: The product entity.
 * - product_url: The product URL.

- product (for all rendered product fields)
 *   Use 'product' to print them all, or print a subset such as
 *   @code
 *   {{ product.title }}
 *   @endcode
 *   Use the following code to exclude the
 *   printing of a given field:
 *   @code
 *   {{ product|without('title') }}
 *   @endcode


- product.title
- product.body (unless the Body field has been deleted for the product type)
- product.variations
- product.uid (for the product Author field)
- product.created
- product.stores
- And product.*field_added_field* for any added fields.

- product.variation_title
- product.variation_sku
- product.variation_price
- And product.*variation_field_added_field* for any added fields.

also:
- product_entity
- product_url
- attributes (not to be confused with product attributes)


If you are not familiar with theming in Drupal, you will want to read the next section of documentation on [Theming Products](../04.theme-products) to get a general overview before looking at specific theming options for product attributes. Theming allows you to further customize the display of product attributes, beyond what is possible using only the administrative UI.

Drupal commerce provides a specific template that can be overriden for product attributes:
- `commerce-product-attribute-value.html.twig`

Also, there is a custom css library for rendered product attributes, located within the Drupal Commerce Product module: `css/commerce_product.rendered-attributes.css`. There are two classes attached to the rendered product attribute element that can be targeted with custom styling:
- `product--rendered-attribute`
- `product--rendered-attribute__selected`
