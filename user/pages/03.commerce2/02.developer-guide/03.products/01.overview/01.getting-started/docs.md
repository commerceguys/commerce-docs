Before you beging adding products to your Drupal Commerce store, it is important to understand the product structure. Let us go through an example.

Let us say that your store sells t-shirts. Your t-shirts come in various sizes; such as small, medium, large, and extra large. Each shirt has a graphic but can come in different colors. Each graphic t-shirt is its own product but has its variations of colors available.

How does that translate into Drupal Commerce?

* There is a **t-shirt** product type
* There is a **size** product attribute
* There is a **color** product attribute
* Each graphic _t-shirt_ will be its own product, with variations of color and size.

The following table is an example of variations that could be for a Drupal Commerce Cart graphic t-shirt.

| Product      | Size        | Color |
|------------------------------------|
| Cart graphic | Small       | Grey  |
| Cart graphic | Small       | White |
| Cart graphic | Small       | Black |
| Cart graphic | Medium      | Grey  |

| Cart graphic | Medium      | Black |
