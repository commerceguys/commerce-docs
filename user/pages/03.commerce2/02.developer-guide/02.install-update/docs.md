##Before you begin

If you are not familiar with using [Composer to manage Drupal dependencies](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-with-drupal), read [Using Composer with Drupal](../../01.getting-started/01.using-composer) before continuing. If you want to avoid using Composer for site management, the [Ludwig module](https://www.drupal.org/project/ludwig) offers a manual alternative to Composer.

Since you are already using the command line, we recommend you use [Drush](http://www.drush.org/) or [Drupal console](https://drupalconsole.com/) for various site management operations.
