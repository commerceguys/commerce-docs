##Before you begin

If you are not familiar with using [Composer to manage Drupal dependencies](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-with-drupal), read Using Composer with Drupal before continuing below. If you are unsure if you want to use composer to update Drupal 8, read the introduction to these instructions which summarizes all your options to choose from. 

Since you are already using the command line, we recommend to use [Drush](http://www.drush.org/) for many operations below.
