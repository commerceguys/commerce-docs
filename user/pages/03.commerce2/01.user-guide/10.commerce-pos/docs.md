POS is enabled in Drupal Commerce 2.x with an external module
[Commerce POS](https://drupal.org/project/commerce_pos). This
module provides a Point of Sale interface for Drupal Commerce,
allowing in-person transactions via cash or card, returns, 
multiple registers and locations. All integrated with Commerce
to allow you to use the same products, customers and orders 
between both systems.
