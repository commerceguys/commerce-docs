## Drupal Commerce Issue Queue
If you are new to Drupal, you will want to learn more about [Drupal issue queues].

Drupal Commerce is an actively maintained project, and oftentimes you'll be
able to search its [Issue Queue] to find an answer to a question or a solution to
a problem/bug. Solutions are usually presented in the form of a patch. See the
[Patching section](../../02.developer-guide/02.install-update/07.patching) of this documentation
guide for information about applying patches.

## Search Drupal Answers on StackExchange
[Drupal Answers] is a question and answer site for Drupal developers and administrators. To search for information specific to Drupal Commerce, tag your queries with `drupal-commerce`. There are thousands of posted [Drupal Commerce questions], so it's a great place to look for help.

## Chat with us on Slack
Drupal Commerce benefits from an active community of developers who participate
in the #commerce [Slack] channel. There is also a general Drupal #support channel
and the Drupal #general channel for light support questions. To join, visit:

## Getting Help: Best Practices
It's important to keep in mind that this is open source software. While some
contributors are paid for their time (usually for specific projects/tasks), a
great many more are donating their time to the community. When asking for help,
you'll find that people can be very friendly and giving but only if they are
treated respectfully. Also, ultimately, it's up to you to solve your own
problems: nobody in the community "works for you". That being said, here are
some general tips on how to get help in a way that's both respectful and
constructive:

 - Start with a search in the project's issue queue. Try to avoid posting
   duplicate issues!
 - If you can't find anything that's applicable to your problem, searching
   Drupal Answers on StackExchange is a good next step. Post a question if none of the existing questions apply to your issue.
 - For more immediate responses, you can try the Commerce Slack channel. Post a general message about the problem you're having, to start. You can get
   into the details in a separate thread. If your problem is a "known issue",
   you'll probably be directed to its Issue page.
 - Chatting with people in the Slack channel may lead to a suggestion to post
   a new Issue.
 - If you're posting an issue for the first time, review [How to create a good issue].
 - Whenever you get responses to your Issue (either in the form of requests for
   additional information or patches), it's helpful if you can respond quickly.
 - Become an active, "giving" member of the Drupal Commerce community yourself.
   Review patches, provide feedback, and help others in the Slack channel
   whenever you can.
