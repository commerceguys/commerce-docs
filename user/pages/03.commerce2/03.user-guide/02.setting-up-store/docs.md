A key component in Drupal Commerce is the store. [Products](../03.products) and [orders](../04.orders) belong to stores. The store controls what billing and shipping countries are available when the customers go to complete checkout.

Each store has a currency. To create a store which uses a new currency, you must [import the currency](01.importing-currencies).

With support for multiple stores, Drupal Commerce allows [specifying a default store](03.change-default-store). The default store is used when a store cannot be determined (a non-product or order page.)
