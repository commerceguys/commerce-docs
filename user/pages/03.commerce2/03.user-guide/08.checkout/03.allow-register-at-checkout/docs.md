## Overview
You can restrict checkout to just users with accounts. You can then either completely deny checkout access to users without accounts or require them to create an account before they can checkout.

You can change this setting on a per Checkout Flow basis, so you can deny guest checkouts for some flows and not others as you need.


## Enable / Disable Account Registration at Checkout

Visit the Commerce configuration page and go to the **Checkout Flows** section.

## Allow guests to create an account during the checkout process

To give your customers the ease of creating an account at the end of their checkout you need to enable the "Guest Registration after checkout" pane in your checkout flow.
