Shipping is enabled in Drupal Commerce 2.x with an external module
[Commerce Shipping](https://drupal.org/project/commerce_shipping). This
module only provides an API and plugins for flat rate (both per order and per
item) shipping functionality. As with Drupal Commerce 1.x, you will need a plugin or plugins 
provided by other module(s) for calculating actual shipping costs with shipping
services. Currently available plugins with status as of 6 March 2018:
  - Flat Rate/Flate per Item - Beta, included in Commerce Shipping.
  - [Fedex](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_fedex) - Alpha.
  - [Commerce Australia Post](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_auspost) - Beta
  - [Commerce NZPost](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_nzpost) - V8.x-2.1
  - [USPS](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_usps) - In progress, not yet functional.
  - Other modules/plugins such as Canada Post, UPS, Kiala have yet to be ported
  or created for Drupal Commerce 2.x.
