In order to accept payments you need to create a payment gateway for your store. Unless you choose a manual gateway you need to first install the relevant module for your chosen payment provider (PayPal, Stripe, Braintree etc.).

After you've installed the module(s) go to /admin/commerce/config/payment-gateways to create and configure your payment gateway(s).

Click 'Add payment gateway', choose your provider from the plugin list and complete the form fields that appears below.
